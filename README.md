In this notebook, we will try to build a model to predict the prices of diamonds based on various features of diamond like carat weight, cut quality ,etc.
some of the conclusions are:

* After wrangling the data we found that there were no null values in the data ,there were no duplicated rows in the data,There were some outliers in the features which we removed them
* We constructed features engineering on categorical columns in our dataset to utitlize them in our model
* After transforming the data We have fitted the data on a Linear regression model which gave us R2 of 89% 
* We tried to use another model that would enhance the previous results so we used Random Forest Regressor which gave us R2 of 98%
